Q:
what Encoding Methods i need to use so they will not end up with the same numeric values after encoding because i use k-means which only for numeric data

A:
If you want to ensure that your categorical and numerical data do not end up with the same numeric values after encoding, especially when using k-means, you can follow these steps:

1. **Separate Your Data Types**: First, split your dataset into two parts: one for categorical data and another for numerical data.

2. **Encoding Categorical Data**: For categorical data, you should use an encoding method that transforms categories into distinct binary columns (not numeric values) to avoid any ordinal implication. The most common method for this purpose is **One-Hot Encoding** or **Dummy Encoding**. Each category will be represented by a set of binary columns (0s and 1s), and no numeric order or similarity will be implied.

   Example:
   ```
   | Category  | Red | Blue | Green |
   |-----------|-----|------|-------|
   | Blue      | 0   | 1    | 0     |
   | Green     | 0   | 0    | 1     |
   | Red       | 1   | 0    | 0     |
   ```

3. **Use Numerical Data as-Is**: For numerical data, you can leave it as-is since it's already in a numeric format compatible with k-means.

4. **Combine the Data**: Once you've encoded the categorical data and kept the numerical data unchanged, you can combine both sets of data into a single dataset for clustering.

By following these steps, you'll ensure that your categorical data is transformed in a way that maintains its distinctiveness and does not create the appearance of numerical similarity. This approach will allow you to use k-means effectively on the combined dataset while avoiding unintended effects due to the encoding process.
